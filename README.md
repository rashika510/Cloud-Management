# IST 615- Cloud-Management
This contains lab work, advanced presentations and project wor of IST 615- Cloud-Management at Syracuse University by Prof. Radhika Garg.

# Key Learnings
1. Build familiarity with key cloud concepts and terminology, understand the economics of cloud computing in general and understand privacy and security implications of cloud-based infrastructure
2. Critically assess cloud services and interpret and analyze key factors to be considered before moving infrastructure to cloud environment, identify the necessary security implementations needed for deploying cloud-service and bring an economic and regulatory perspective to development of cloud-based service
3. Manage cloud environments 'as a service',make strategic choices for cloud digital service creation and monetization across different platforms, assess accurately how cloud management approaches, technology, policy and governance may affect human users, devices/other non-person entities,
and individual organizations, use capacity management tools to monitor the health of the services or applications and design, configure, and manage cloud, hybrid, and on-premises based information services in digital enterprise environments.
4. Create own cloud-based application and use services provided by vendors to host application in the cloud environment and identify the optimal cloud service platform to host the application in order to minimize the cost and maximize the performance of the application.
